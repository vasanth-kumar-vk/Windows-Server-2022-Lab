# 🖥️ Windows Server 2022 Administration Lab

> **Full Active Directory domain deployment with DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, IIS, file shares, audit policy, system state backup, and PowerShell automation — built from scratch on VMware.**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project simulates a single-site enterprise Windows Server environment. A Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller (DC01) manages a domain-joined Windows 10 client (CLIENT1) with full identity management, network services, security hardening, and automation using PowerShell scripts.

Every component was configured, tested, and documented following Microsoft best practices.

## 📡 Network Configuration

| Device | Interface | IP | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| DC01 | Ethernet0 (VMnet1) | 192.168.10.2 | Static — Domain Controller, DNS, DHCP |
| DC01 | Ethernet1 (VMnet8) | 192.168.58.x | DHCP — Internet access only |
| CLIENT1 | Ethernet0 (VMnet1) | 192.168.10.50 | DHCP reserved by MAC |
| VMware Host | VMnet1 | 192.168.10.1 | Host access |

---

## 🔒 Group Policy Objects

| GPO Name | Linked To | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| Default Domain Policy | `lab.local` | Password: min 8 chars, complexity, 90-day max |
| Default Domain Policy | `lab.local` | Lockout: 3 attempts, 30 min lock, 15 min reset |
| IT_DEPT_Wallpaper | `IT_DEPARTMENT` OU | Desktop wallpaper via UNC path |
| IT_DEPT_Restrictions | `IT_DEPARTMENT` OU | Block access to Control Panel & PC Settings |
| IT_DEPT_IEZone | `IT_DEPARTMENT` OU | Add DC01.lab.local to IE Intranet Zone |

## 🤖 PowerShell Automation Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ServiceCheck.ps1` | Checks 7 critical Windows services — color-coded green/red output |
| `BulkCreateUsers.ps1` | Creates multiple AD users from CSV — full account provisioning |
| `ADUserReport.ps1` | Exports all OU users to CSV — Name, SAM, enabled status, last password set |
| `UnlockAccounts.ps1` | Finds and unlocks all locked AD accounts — most common helpdesk task |
| `InactiveUsers.ps1` | Finds users inactive 30+ days — security audit and cleanup |
| `AddUsersToGroup.ps1` | Adds all OU users to security group — role-based access control |
| `UpdateDepartment.ps1` | Updates Department attribute for all OU users in bulk |

## 🐛 Real Issues Solved

These are real troubleshooting scenarios encountered during the build — not lab book exercises:

- **GPO not applying:** DC01 had a duplicate DNS A record pointing to NAT IP (192.168.58.x). CLIENT1 was resolving DC01 to an unreachable IP. Fixed by deleting the stale DNS record.
- **Account Lockout not working:** Policy was applied at OU level. Windows only applies lockout policy from Default Domain Policy — not OUs. Moved policy to correct level.
- **Static IP reverting:** VMware IP conflict between host adapter (.1) and DC01 (.2). Fixed with PowerShell instead of GUI to force correct binding.
- **RDP denied for domain user:** Domain Controllers restrict RDP to Administrators by default. Granted access via GPO — User Rights Assignment in Default Domain Controllers Policy.

## 🚀 How to Replicate This Lab

1. Install **VMware Workstation** — create VMnet1 (Host-only, 192.168.10.0/24) and VMnet8 (NAT)
2. Create DC01 VM: Windows Server 2022, 4GB RAM, dual NIC (VMnet1 + VMnet8)
3. Create CLIENT1 VM: Windows 10 Pro, 4GB RAM, single NIC (VMnet1)
4. On DC01: set static IP 192.168.10.2, install AD DS, promote to domain controller for `lab.local`
5. Follow documentation for DNS, DHCP, GPO, file shares, IIS, backup, and PowerShell scripts
